### Typical Recipe Search

- Find Typical recipes by keyword and importantly by amount of protein, fat, and sugar
- Exclude even more ingredients as if a Typical diet isn't restrictive enough
- All recipes are Typical by default because that's all I'm interested in
- This uses RapidAPI, don't forget to remove billing info at some point
- This concludes the Readme
- Tailwind... hmm
- Version 0.1 was called "Vegan Recipe Search" but has since been renamed 
- Version 0.2 was called "Plant-based Recipe Search" but has since been renamed
- Version 0.3 has been forgotten
- This now concludes the Readme
- Also has Book Search (/books)
- NOW with persistent global API credit checks to prevent unwanted billing
- This is now Version 0.4 
- Theme needs improvement
