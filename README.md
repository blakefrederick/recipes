### Plant-based Recipe Search

- Find Plant-based recipes by keyword and importantly by amount of protein, fat, and sugar
- Exclude even more ingredients as if a Plant-based diet isn't restrictive enough
- All recipes are Plant-based by default because that's all I'm interested in
- This uses RapidAPI, don't forget to remove billing info at some point
- This concludes the Readme
- Tailwind exists and I'm not sure I'm fully into it yet but I will reserve judgement
- Version 0.1 was called "Vegan Recipe Search" but has since been renamed  not because of the connotation but for some reason I just have never preferred it, something about exclusionary vs inclusionary, aka my built-up connotation based on meeting people and places using that word
- This now concludes the Readme
- Now with NEW Book Search (/books)
